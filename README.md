### About me
I am a Postdoc at [BICMR](http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn) in Peking working with [Jinpeng An](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/anjp/).  I am interested in homogeneous dynamics and its applications.  

I obtained my Phd degree from mathematics department at The Ohio State University in 2020.  My advisor is [Nimish Shah](https://people.math.osu.edu/shah.595/).

Before that I received my Bachelor's degree in mathematics from Chongqing University in 2014.
