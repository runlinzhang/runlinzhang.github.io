### About me

I work in [math department](http://sci.cqu.edu.cn) of Chongqing University.  I am interested in homogeneous dynamics and its applications.

I was a Postdoc at [BICMR](http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn) in Peking working with [Jinpeng An](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/anjp/). 

I obtained my Phd degree from mathematics department at The Ohio State University in 2020.  My advisor is [Nimish Shah](https://people.math.osu.edu/shah.595/).

Before that I received my Bachelor's degree in mathematics from Chongqing University in 2014.
