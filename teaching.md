- [课程大纲](https://runlinzhang.github.io/2022齐性动力系统课程大纲.pdf?raw=true)

- [Lecture 1](https://runlinzhang.github.io/Lec1.pdf?raw=true)

- [Lecture 2](https://runlinzhang.github.io/Lec2.pdf?raw=true)

Correction:
1. page 4, equa.5. the left lower coner should be "c_n" instead of blank. 
2. page 4, Lemma 2.7, "Homeo(X)" should be "Homeo(Z)".
3. page 5, the line above Claim 2.1. "G/B homeo to H^2" should be replaced by "G/B homeo to \partial H^2";
4. page 6, there are typos in the "Proof of the Claim", I shall correct them later.

- [Lecture 3](https://runlinzhang.github.io/Lec3.pdf?raw=true)

Correction:
1. the proof on the bottom of page 6 has an error, rmk 3.3 should also be used;
2. page 4, in the middle there is a long equation above "now choose v_2 \in ...". In the second row of that equation, replace "\pi_1(v_1)" by "v_1" and "v_2" by "\pi_1(v_2)"

- [Lecture 4](https://runlinzhang.github.io/Lec4.pdf?raw=true)

Correction:
1. page 3, sec 2.2 case 3: I should add "y_n \in Y_1".
2. page 8, the equation after "Define h_{n,\delta}' by": there should be an "=" between "exp()" and the matrix.
3. page 2, I forgot to define what Y_0 is...it is the closure of the orbit of H as in Thm 1.1.

- [Exercise sheet 1](https://runlinzhang.github.io/EXER_1.pdf?raw=true)

Correction:
1. Exer 0.8, "for every \epsilon >0" should be "for every \epsilon \in (0,1)"

- [Lecture 5](https://runlinzhang.github.io/Lec5.pdf?raw=true)

Correction:
1. page 3, line number 1: "Lem.2.2" should be "Lem.2.3"
2. page 3, the argument on the top of this page is a bit wrong. We should only pick a minimal Y_1 under the assumption of case 1. Without this assumption it is not clear why this set admits a minimal element. 
3. page 4, line 1-4, there is a serious gap in case 2. We will resolve this issue in a later lecture. Actually the gap is so serious that it ruins the proof of main theorem of this note. The nondivergence part is unaffected.

- [Lecture 6](https://runlinzhang.github.io/Lec6.pdf?raw=true)

- [Lecture 7](https://runlinzhang.github.io/Lec7.pdf?raw=true)

- [Exercise sheet 2](https://runlinzhang.github.io/EXER_2.pdf?raw=true)

Correction:
1. Exer5.3, should assume limit(\Gamma) is infinite.

- [Lecture 8](https://runlinzhang.github.io/Lec8.pdf?raw=true)

Correction:
1. page 5, the equation above Example 4.3, M^t should be M^s;
2. page 2, remark 1.3, first line, "take some probability measure" should be "take some Borel probability measure";

- [Lecture 9](https://runlinzhang.github.io/Lec9.pdf?raw=true)

Correction:
1. page 5, below the picture, equation (4), the left upper corner of the matrix should be "1+a_n+tc_n";
2. page 6, below equation (5), the second line, "y''_{n,\delta}=u_{s'_{n,\delta}}..." should be  "y''_{n,\delta}=u_{t'_{n,\delta}}...";

- [Lecture 9.5](https://runlinzhang.github.io/Lec9.5.pdf?raw=true)

- [Lecture 10](https://runlinzhang.github.io/Lec10.pdf?raw=true)

Correction:
1. page 1, Thm 1.1, in the equation, \delta_{x_0} should be \delta_{\Lambda_0}; also, in front of the integral symbol, there is a \frac{1}{S} missing;
2. page 6, many places... \widetilde{\Omega}_{\varepsilon} and \widetilde{\Omega}_{i} are the same thing;

- [Exercise sheet 3](https://runlinzhang.github.io/EXER_3.pdf?raw=true)

Correction:
1. page 1, section 1, 2nd line, the v_r should be lower triangular with (2,1)-entry equal to r;
