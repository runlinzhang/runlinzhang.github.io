- [课程大纲](https://runlinzhang.github.io/2022齐性动力系统课程大纲.pdf?raw=true)

- [Lecture 1](https://runlinzhang.github.io/Lec1.pdf?raw=true)

- [Lecture 2](https://runlinzhang.github.io/Lec2.pdf?raw=true)

Correction:
1. page 4, equa.5. the left lower coner should be "c_n" instead of blank. 
2. page 4, Lemma 2.7, "Homeo(X)" should be "Homeo(Z)".
3. page 5, the line above Claim 2.1. "G/B homeo to H^2" should be replaced by "G/B homeo to \partial H^2";
4. page 6, there are typos in the "Proof of the Claim", I shall correct them later.

- [Lecture 3](https://runlinzhang.github.io/Lec3.pdf?raw=true)

Correction:
1. the proof on the bottom of page 6 has an error, rmk 3.3 should also be used;
2. page 4, in the middle there is a long equation above "now choose v_2 \in ...". In the second row of that equation, replace "\pi_1(v_1)" by "v_1" and "v_2" by "\pi_1(v_2)"

- [Lecture 4](https://runlinzhang.github.io/Lec4.pdf?raw=true)

Correction:
1. page 3, sec 2.2 case 3: I should add "y_n \in Y_1".
2. page 8, the equation after "Define h_{n,\delta}' by": there should be an "=" between "exp()" and the matrix.
3. page 2, rather than Lem.2.1, we might have started with a H-minimal Y_0 and argue that \calO defined there is empty. (btw, I forgot to define what Y_0 is...it is the closure of the orbit of H as in Thm 1.1.)

- [Lecture 5](https://runlinzhang.github.io/Lec5.pdf?raw=true)

Correction:
1. page 3, line number 1: "Lem.2.2" should be "Lem.2.3"
